              As Stephen Hawking once said, “whether you want to uncover the
              secrets of the universe or you just want to pursue a career, basic
              computer programming is an essential skill to learn.”

              The gender gap in tech did not always exist. In fact, from the
              Second World War until the 1960s, women constituted the majority
              of the technically trained workforce in the computing industry! In
              these early days, computing was seen as an unskilled and menial
              task, despite the fact that women were instrumental in wartime
              work that cracked the Enigma Code and calculated military
              logistics. Once industry wised up to the potential of computing
              and understood the power and prestige that tech could bring, women
              were pushed out. And today they remain seriously underrepresented
              in computer science and programming, comprising just over one
              fifth of programmers in the U.S. There are barriers facing girls
              interested in tech at every stage of their journey, from school
              all the way to their career. But the earlier these issues are
              tackled in a girl’s life, the better – as programming can open
              many doors for them.

              A female perspective in evolving tech industries is crucial, as
              women and girls are overwhelmingly affected by digital
              developments. The rate of mental health issues among young girls
              has skyrocketed since the rise of social media and ubiquity of
              smart phones, and women are more likely to fall victim to the dark
              corners of the internet – incel communities, cyberstalking and
              doxing. Women in tech will be in a powerful position to influence
              these industries as they evolve, guiding developments such as AI,
              data privacy, social media algorithms, and regulation of online
              hate speech.
