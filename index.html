            <h2>Why Coding and Why the Gap?</h2>
            <h3>
              As Stephen Hawking once said, “whether you want to uncover the
              secrets of the universe or you just want to pursue a career, basic
              computer programming is an essential skill to learn.”
            </h3>
            <p>
              The gender gap in tech did not always exist. In fact, from the
              Second World War until the 1960s, women constituted the majority
              of the technically trained workforce in the computing industry! In
              these early days, computing was seen as an unskilled and menial
              task, despite the fact that women were instrumental in wartime
              work that cracked the Enigma Code and calculated military
              logistics. Once industry wised up to the potential of computing
              and understood the power and prestige that tech could bring, women
              were pushed out. And today they remain seriously underrepresented
              in computer science and programming, comprising just over one
              fifth of programmers in the U.S. There are barriers facing girls
              interested in tech at every stage of their journey, from school
              all the way to their career. But the earlier these issues are
              tackled in a girl’s life, the better – as programming can open
              many doors for them.

                <h4>Augusta Ada Lovelace</h4>
                <p>
                  Born: December 10, 1815, London, United Kingdom / Died:
                  November 27, 1852

                  The unofficial title of the Grand Dame of computer programming
                  goes to a woman who had a real title. She was the Countess of
                  Lovelace, the daughter of the poet Lord Byron. Her main claim
                  to fame, though, had nothing to do with her royal title,
                  except it’s perhaps the reason she was taken seriously at all.
                  Ada Lovelace, a mathematician, and writer, lived in the early
                  19th century. She was best known for her work with Charles
                  Babbage in creating the first mechanical computer, called the
                  analytical engine, to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
                  Babbage asked Ada to translate an article from French to
                  English about the analytical engine that was written by the
                  Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal.
                  Not only did Ada translate, but she also added her own notes,
                  which ended up being longer than the article. Her notes were
                  published in 1843 in an English science journal. Her notes
                  detailed how people could use codes of letters, symbols, and
                  numbers to instruct computers to complete complex
                  calculations. Ada is often called the first computer
                  programmer. In the early 1980s, the U.S. Department of
                  DefenseOpens a new window named a language after Ada, not
                  surprisingly, called Ada.

                <h4>Annie Easley</h4>
                <p>
                  Born: April 23, 1933, Birmingham, AL / Died: June 25, 2011
                </p>
                <p>
                  Annie Easley was another coding pioneer who got her start
                  during the space age. Easley fell in love with computers
                  before ever even seeing one. In 1955, she read a newspaper
                  story about twin sisters who worked for the National Advisory
                  Committee for Aeronautics. The next day, she put in her
                  application with the space agency and began working there
                  within two weeks. Easley worked as a mathematician and
                  computer programmer before even receiving a college degree. In
                  the 1970s, he went on to graduate with a BS in computer
                  science from Cleveland State University. She also took
                  advantage of courses offered by NASA. When she started, Easley
                  was one of just four African-Americans working in the Plum
                  Brook Reactor Facility. She said in an interviewOpens a new
                  window that she didn’t consider herself a pioneer. “I just
                  have my own attitude. I’m out here to get the job done, and I
                  knew I had the ability to do it, and that’s where my focus
                  was.” Even in the face of discrimination, she persevered. “My
                  head is not in the sand. But my thing is, if I can’t work with
                  you, I will work around you. I was not about to be [so]
                  discouraged that I’d walk away. That may be a solution for
                  some people, but it’s not mine.” She was originally put to
                  work as a “human computer,” who had to conduct complex
                  calculations by hand. Eventually, NASA began using computers,
                  and Easley adapted without a problem. She learned to code
                  using Fortran and the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
                  language.

                <p>Born: August 4, 1932, Peru, NY</p>
                <p>
                  One of the most relatable stories about women in coding comes
                  from Frances AllenOpens a new window, who is best known for
                  her groundbreaking work in optimizing compilers. Like many
                  career women in the mid-20th century, she went to school for
                  teaching at the New York State College for Teachers (which
                  eventually became part of the State University of New York at
                  Albany). She graduated with a bachelor’s in science degree in
                  math and went on to become a teacher. Two years after
                  graduating, she pursued her master of science degree in
                  mathematics at the University of Michigan. Like many today,
                  Allen found herself buried under student loan debt. That’s
                  when she began working for the Thomas J. Watson Research
                  Center at IBM and taught Fortran to employees. While Allen
                  planned to leave IBM once she paid her debt, she retired after
                  working for the company for 45 years. Allen’s many awards and
                  accolades include the IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage
                  Award and the Ada Lovelace Award from the Association of Women
                  in Computing. She was the first woman to win the Turing Award
                  and she was the first woman to earn an IBM fellowship. A Ph.D.
                  IBM Fellowship Award was created in her honor. She is a Fellow
                  of the IEEE and the Association for Computing Machinery. Allen
                  retired from IBM in 2002.
